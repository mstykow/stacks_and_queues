# Stacks and Queues

This is an exercise in data structures dealing with implementations and applications of stacks and queues.

We begin by [implementing a stack](https://github.com/mstykow/stacks_and_queues/blob/master/stack.py), followed by [implementing a queue directly and by using two stacks](https://github.com/mstykow/stacks_and_queues/blob/master/queue.py). Finally, we use a stack to [check if a string of mixed brackets is balanced](https://github.com/mstykow/stacks_and_queues/blob/master/balanced_brackets.py).

The exercises come from [here](https://medium.com/@kojinoshiba/data-structures-in-python-series-2-stacks-queues-8e2a1703d67b).
